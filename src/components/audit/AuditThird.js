              An accurate analysis of your website is going to answer each of
              these unique questions and also do so in a type of high detail.
              You'll have a set of data called objective data. You can use this
              data to implement great goals for your business.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be completely frank, you shouldn't be spending precious time
              doing a though website analysis unless of course your company has
              an in-house marketing and your only personal responsibility is
              driving up performance from your company's online initiatives.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the contrary, you need to concentrate on the job you excel at.
              Any time you spend doing something else is not doing you or your
              business any favors. Plus this stuff requires a lot of man hours
              you could spend doing on something productive.
            </p>
